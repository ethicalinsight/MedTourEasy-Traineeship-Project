# 📽️🗃️MedTourEasy Traineeship Project

This repository showcases a healthcare-focused machine learning project developed during my **MedTourEasy Data Analytics traineeship**, supported by the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate** (earned via scholarship). It contains all the essential components of a predictive modeling workflow—from data cleaning and exploratory analysis to classification and dashboarding.

The core objective was to build a model that predicts whether a person is likely to donate blood based on historical donation data. This project reflects my growing expertise in ethical, impact-driven analytics and demonstrates how certification-based learning can be translated into real-world healthcare solutions.

Inside this repository, you'll find:
- 🧹 Cleaned datasets and preprocessing scripts  
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebooks  
- 🤖 Machine learning models and evaluation metrics  
- 📈 Power BI dashboard for stakeholder presentation  
- 📝 Documentation outlining methodology, tools, and impact

# 🩸 Predicting Blood Donation Project

## 🩸 Project Introduction

The **Predicting Blood Donation** project was developed during my traineeship at **MedTourEasy**, a healthcare analytics platform focused on real-world impact. This initiative aimed to forecast potential blood donors using historical donation data—supporting smarter outreach and resource planning in medical settings.

🔍 Built with guidance from MTE mentors and powered by skills gained through the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate** (earned via scholarship), the project combines ethical data handling with practical machine learning techniques.

📊 From cleaning and exploring data to training classification models and designing a stakeholder-ready dashboard, this project reflects my commitment to building scalable, responsible solutions in healthcare analytics.

✨ Key highlights:
- Predictive modeling using Python  
- Feature engineering and EDA  
- Power BI dashboard for insights  
- Ethical framing and communication  

This project bridges certification learning with hands-on execution—demonstrating how data science can drive meaningful change in healthcare as well as strengthens my technical foundation in Python and visualization tools but also helped me apply ethical storytelling and stakeholder communication—skills honed through the Google certification program.


## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Build a classification model to predict donor likelihood  
- Apply exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering  
- Present findings through a stakeholder-friendly dashboard  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Power BI  
- GitHub  

## 🚀 Key Contributions

- Cleaned and analyzed donor datasets to uncover patterns  
- Engineered features to improve model accuracy  
- Trained and evaluated multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
- Designed a visual dashboard to communicate results effectively  

## 🎓 Certification Support

This project was enriched by the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**, whose accessed was provided through a scholarship. The program strengthened my skills in:
- Data cleaning and visualization  
- Survey design and stakeholder communication  
- Ethical framing and storytelling with data  

## 🌍 Impact

The model offers a scalable approach to identifying potential donors, helping optimize outreach and resource allocation in healthcare settings.
